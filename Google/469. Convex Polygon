多边形判断凸包

ABxBC For each set of three adjacent points A, B, C, find the cross product AB X BC. If the sign of
      all the cross products is the same, the angles are all positive or negative (depending on the
      order in which we visit them) so the polygon is convex.
AB x BC = (Ax - Bx) * (Ay - By)  x  (Bx - Cx) * (By - Cy)
        = (Ax - Bx) * (By - Cy) - (Ay - By) * (Bx - Cx)
        
A X B = x1*y2 - x2*y1
